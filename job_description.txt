About the job
Job title: Data Scientist

Salary: £72k

Location: Pier Walk, North Greenwich

Contract Type: Permanent TFL Band 3

Overview Of Project/role

The Data Scientist will collaborate closely with the Lead Data Scientist, Principal Data Scientist and cross-functional teams to design, deliver and continually enhance advanced data-driven solutions and analytical insights for TfL. You will prepare, structure and analyse diverse datasets (structured and unstructured) to ensure they're robust, reliable and fit for analytical purposes, including suitability for leveraging AI and Generative AI techniques.

Your role requires you to apply statistical, mathematical and scientific methods including exploratory data analysis, predictive modelling, machine learning, deep learning, hypothesis testing, optimisation techniques and emerging Generative AI methodologies to extract meaningful insights that inform strategic and operational decisions. You'll confidently evaluate analytical models and methodologies, refining and validating their effectiveness, with particular attention to optimising the performance of machine learning models.

You will engage proactively with stakeholders to define business problems clearly and translate them into analytical projects. Your strong communication skills will ensure that complex findings are presented clearly through compelling visualisations and narratives, tailored to technical and non-technical audiences alike. You will be skilled at highlighting potential applications of AI-driven solutions in an accessible, inspiring way, guiding stakeholders who are new to the technology toward practical, value-adding solutions

As part of your responsibilities, you will explore innovative analytical techniques, contributing to TfL’s culture of continuous learning and improvement, including staying abreast of advancements in AI and Generative AI. You will also promote adherence to best practices (including ethical standards) for model training and development, deployment and performance monitoring (MLOps).
